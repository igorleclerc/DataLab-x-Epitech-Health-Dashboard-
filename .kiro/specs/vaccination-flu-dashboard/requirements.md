# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vaccination and Flu Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization platform designed for the Élysée DataLab hackathon. The system will display French vaccination coverage and flu surveillance data from 2021-2024 through an interactive map-centric interface with supporting statistical charts, similar to humanitarian dashboard layouts. The focus is on clear, immediate data visualization without complex filtering interfaces.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard_System**: The complete web application that displays vaccination and flu data visualizations through a map-centric interface
- **Interactive_Map**: The primary visualization component showing French departments with color-coded vaccination/flu data
- **Statistics_Panel**: The component displaying key metrics, charts, and demographic breakdowns alongside the map
- **Data_Processor**: The component that parses, validates, and transforms CSV files into usable formats for map and chart visualization
- **User_Interface**: The Next.js frontend that presents the map and statistics in a clean, humanitarian dashboard style
- **CSV_Dataset**: The collection of vaccination and flu surveillance data files covering 2021-2024

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a public health analyst, I want to view vaccination coverage data through an interactive map of French departments, so that I can immediately identify regional patterns and coverage levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard, THE Interactive_Map SHALL display French departments with color-coded vaccination coverage data
2. WHEN a user hovers over a department, THE Interactive_Map SHALL show detailed information including department name, coverage percentage, and population data
3. WHEN a user clicks on a department, THE Statistics_Panel SHALL update to show detailed metrics for that specific department
4. THE Interactive_Map SHALL use a clear color gradient to represent vaccination coverage levels from low to high
5. THE Dashboard_System SHALL display the map prominently as the primary visualization element

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a healthcare researcher, I want to view key statistics and demographic breakdowns alongside the map, so that I can understand the overall health situation at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the dashboard, THE Statistics_Panel SHALL display key metrics including total population, vaccination coverage percentages, and demographic breakdowns
2. WHEN a department is selected on the map, THE Statistics_Panel SHALL update to show statistics specific to that department
3. THE Statistics_Panel SHALL display age group breakdowns with clear visual indicators (icons and charts)
4. THE Statistics_Panel SHALL show vaccination progress over time through simple trend indicators
5. THE Dashboard_System SHALL maintain consistent visual styling between the map and statistics panel

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a healthcare researcher, I want to view flu surveillance data through the same map interface, so that I can analyze emergency visits and medical consultations geographically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches to flu surveillance mode, THE Interactive_Map SHALL display departments color-coded by flu activity levels
2. WHEN viewing flu data, THE Statistics_Panel SHALL show emergency visit rates, SOS Médecins consultations, and age group breakdowns
3. THE Interactive_Map SHALL allow toggling between vaccination coverage and flu surveillance data views
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL maintain the same interaction patterns (hover, click) for both vaccination and flu data
5. THE Data_Processor SHALL parse flu surveillance CSV files and aggregate data by department for map visualization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to automatically process and validate CSV data, so that I can trust the accuracy of map visualizations and statistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts, THE Data_Processor SHALL automatically load and validate all CSV files in the data directory
2. THE Data_Processor SHALL aggregate departmental data for map visualization and calculate coverage percentages
3. THE Data_Processor SHALL handle missing values and data inconsistencies gracefully without breaking the map or statistics
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL display data quality indicators showing the completeness of departmental coverage
5. THE Data_Processor SHALL normalize data formats to ensure consistent map coloring and statistical calculations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive interface without complex filters, so that I can immediately understand the health situation through the map and key statistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Interface SHALL be fully responsive and functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. THE Dashboard_System SHALL load quickly and display the map and statistics without requiring user configuration
3. THE User_Interface SHALL provide simple toggle controls to switch between vaccination and flu surveillance data
4. THE Dashboard_System SHALL follow accessibility best practices for screen readers and keyboard navigation
5. THE User_Interface SHALL use a clean, humanitarian dashboard design style with clear visual hierarchy and minimal clutter
